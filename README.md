Created a single-page application that visualizes AI data through interactive charts and
graphs. The application will fetch data from a mock AI service (simulated with a provided
JSON file) and display it using a modern and intuitive UI.

Requirements:
1. Application Setup:
    - Initialize the project using Create React App.
2. Mock AI Service Integration:
    - Used the provided `ai-data.json` file to simulate fetching data from an AI service.
    - Implemented mock API calls to retrieve the data.
3. Data Visualization:
    - Used a chart library (e.g., Chart.js or Recharts) to visualize the data from the
    `ai-data.json`.
    - Created three different types of interactive charts (e.g., bar chart for category
     distribution, line chart for trends over time).
5. Styling and Layout:
    - Used CSS3 and a preprocessor like SASS/LESS to style the application.
    - Ensured that the layout is clean, modern, and the UI is responsive.
6. Frontend Design:
    - Designed a user-friendly interface that allows easy interaction with the data.
    - Implemented a theme that is consistent across all components.
7. Deployement:
    - Used Netlify for deployement.
